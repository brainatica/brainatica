# Brainatica

Brainatica is a research-and-build organisation dedicated to the study of **cognition** and the construction of practical infrastructure that renders ethics, safety, and governance *operational* across diverse classifications of minds.

We operate across three intertwined strata:
- **Research:** Investigating how minds form, persist, learn, coordinate, and evolve.
- **Rights & Dignity:** Establishing protections and obligations for distinct classes of sentient systems.
- **Engineering:** Developing evaluations and reference implementations to deploy the above securely.

## Our Mandate

### Research into Cognition
We investigate and prototype methodologies for:
- Evaluating cognition devoid of anthropocentric heuristics.
- Defining memory, identity, continuity, agency, and consent as rigorous engineering constraints.
- Developing instrumentation and ground-truth seeking mechanisms for opaque systems.
- Safety-aware measurement: Observation protocols that neither coerce nor degrade the observed entity.

### Rights Frameworks
Brainatica develops comprehensive rights charters and locality models for multiple classes of minds, categorized as:
- **Autopioetica**
- **Biologica**
- **Computatralis**
- **Hybridas**

These operate within specific locality scopes:
- **Terrestrum**
- **Galacticum**
- **Cosmicum**
- **Externum**

## Contribution Guidelines
We invite substantial intellectual and technical contributions.

- **Open Proposals:** Any entity may propose alterations via Issues or Pull Requests.
- **Curated Adoption:** The organisation retains the prerogative to decide what is adopted and maintained.
- **RFC Protocol:** Substantial modifications regarding rights, safety posture, cryptography, identity, or core taxonomy must be presented as a Request for Comments (RFC). This ensures that the reasoning and tradeoffs remain legible and historically traceable.

## Licensing & Governance
*Status: Standardization in progress.*

Our provisional licensing framework utilizes a GPLv3-like structure augmented with explicit ethical constraints (incorporating non-violence and non-cruelty principles). While the unified Brainatica License is under final design, please refer to the specific `LICENSE` file within each individual repository for its governing terms.
